# Coding Study Log (When review, just view files w/o numbers or protos on them)

Alright, so, I didnâ€™t get a chance to write this down on the day (was completely chased by time TT), but last Friday was pretty eventful. I focused on wrapping up my card game project, tying up all the loose ends and making sure it ran smoothly.
Then, I decided it was time to start something that actually really excites me: Pokemon! So I kicked off a new project to build my very own Pokedex. Itâ€™s been a while since I touched CSS seriously (felt like a million years), so styling things nicely was surprisingly tough â€” but also kind of fun. In the end, it wasnâ€™t too shabby at all.

Today, I completed the Pokedex project! ðŸŽ‰ It feels satisfying to see it all come together, especially since itâ€™s something tied to my personal interests. Now that itâ€™s done, Iâ€™m thinking of the next step: I want to build a site and connect my Pokedex to it, so it feels like a proper app hosted out there in the wild.

And github really needs some manual to making a site or sth, it really is not working for me today. TT
