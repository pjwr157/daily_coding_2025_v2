# Coding Study Log (When review, just view files w/o numbers or protos on them)

Today, I started working on the board (forum) feature of our project.
I managed to set up all the basic structures; from MySQL to the backend and the frontend. It feels good to have the foundation ready so I can build on it without worrying about major rewrites later.

I even had some extra time today, so I left helpful comments in the code to remind myself of key points; things that might save me trouble down the line. I also did a bit of CSS styling, jussst enough to give it a cleaner look. Honestly, it doesn’t look bad at all right now. I wonder if I’ll still think the same when I revisit this months later.

Anyhow, another solid day. Good job today and let’s keep going.

<!-- So, yes, last friday I did the table tennis. But that ain't the main point. So the reason why I was absent yesterday, was due to the interview I got with the CEO of the Korean branch of NMB. I think I did good and I got my chance to take the final interview for NMB!!
How cool is that? The date for the final part isn't decided yet, but is sure to come. Better get ready for it. ; 2025.07.15 -->
