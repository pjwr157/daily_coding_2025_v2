# Coding Study Log (When review, just view files w/o numbers or protos on them)

Alright, Today, once again, I tried to wrap up my Git studies.
I played around with rebase one more time and also explored how to use Git through both VS Code and STS3.
To be honest I found using Git with STS3 surprisingly unintuitive; it just wasn’t very fun to navigate.

After that, me and my tean, we discussed how we’ll handle team invitations and pushing/pulling to GitHub for our upcoming projects. It was good to get on the same page before diving in. Unfortunately, none of us actually have experience in utilizing github, so we will see how this will go TT

And then,,, I spent the rest of the day working on our team project. I kinda managed to get the basic framework in place… well, sort of. It’s honestly still a mess and there’s a lot that needs fixing. But at least it’s something to build on.

Tomorrow, I’ll keep tackling all the rough edges and try to clean things up. Fighto!

<!-- So the interview is to be scheduled for next Monday. Gotta make a self promotion presentation. Which means I'll be busy this weekend making slides and preparing for a presentation and an interview! Welp, fighto ; 2025.07.08 -->
