# Coding Study Log (When review, just view files w/o numbers or protos on them)

Alright, Today, once again, I took a deeper dive into Git.
Today felt like taking a little time-travel tour with Git.
I practiced a bunch of new things: using revert, exploring fetch and understanding how it differs from pull, deleting remote branches, checking out past commits and then making new commits from there, and even experimenting with rebase. It was a great hands-on way to see how Git manages history.

But the real highlight is that today, I officially started my first team project as a developer.
This is part of the training program after receiving an informal offer(Japanese job offer thing) from the Japanese company CAL. It’s my first real project as a developer, which is pretty exciting.

Our project is to build a web application related to convenience store products. Right now, there are four of us working together, building out the basic CRUD pages. I’m in charge of the Delete functionality, but since I also wanted to understand the whole structure, I set up most of the XML files and laid out the general framework for everyone. Feels good to see it coming together.

For tomorrow, my plan is to work more on the React JS frontend, hook it up, and start seeing the full flow from front to back.
