# Coding Study Log

Alright, so today, I spent most(a lot) of my time diving deep into Axios, a JavaScript library used for connecting with APIs.
At first, I ran into a few timing issues, like trying to display the data before it was fully loaded, but after a bit of trial and error, I understood that handling asynchronous behavior properly is key. I also practiced catching errors and realized how important it is to prepare for when something goes wrong, like when the API doesn’t respond or returns an error.
It was a challenging day, but a rewarding one. I'm still at the beginning, but I feel like I’ve taken a meaningful step forward in learning how to work with real data and build dynamic applications. Tomorrow, I’d like to try working with other request types like PUT and DELETE, and maybe even try integrating an API into a simple React component.
Surprisingly, I actually enjoy playing with Axios!
