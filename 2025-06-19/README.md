# Coding Study Log

Although I began studying coding a few weeks ago... I’ve decided to start recording my progress from today. From this day on, this record will help me better reflect on how my understanding and thinking evolve over time.

Alright, so for today, I finalized the Card Game Practice project to reinforce my understanding of useState. I also explored how useEffect works and began to grasp its role in managing side effects in React components.

After that, I studied event handling in React. I learned stuff such as SyntheticEvent and noted that events like onClick will be among the most frequently used in practical development.

Next, I focused on how React manages forms (an essential part of building interactive UIs). As for the code I wrote while studying events and forms, I plan to upload it to GitHub on Friday (tmr), if possible.

Lastly, I got my first taste of working with Axios. It is quite a fascinating library for handling HTTP requests, and I’m looking forward to exploring it further.

<!-- Hope this record continues on and on. -->
