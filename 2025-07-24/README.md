# Coding Study Log (When review, just view files w/o numbers or protos on them)

Today,  I continued working on the project improvement phase.
Unfortunately, the teammate I was supposed to work with was absent, so we couldn’t finish the parts we had planned to tackle together. But I tried to make the most of the time by focusing on what I could handle alone.

After that, I explored something completely new; Arduino.
I worked with an UNO board, connecting it to my computer and learning about various components like sensors, Bluetooth modules, and the coding needed to make everything work. It was fascinating to see the code translate directly into physical reactions. I think that instant feedback is what made it so fun and refreshing; like seeing programming come to life.

Tomorrow evening, I’ll be heading back to my hometown.
I need to pack up, help my parents with their move, and bring back some summer suits my dad no longer wears. It’s going to be a busy.
