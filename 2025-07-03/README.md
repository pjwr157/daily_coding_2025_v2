# Coding Study Log (When review, just view files w/o numbers or protos on them)

Alright, so let us catch up;

(Tuesday – July 2)
Tuesday was mostly about checking out my Pokedex project again; revisiting it with fresh eyes. After that, I decided to dive into something totally new for me: connecting React JS with Spring. Honestly, I still don’t quite get how it all ties together; frontend talking to backend, REST APIs, managing state, and everything in between; but I’m trying to piece it together step by step.

(Wednesday – July 3)
Not much to report for yesterday. I wasn’t feeling too well, so I decided to rest up and take it easy. Actually I slept for the whole day. It really is sad to be sick all alone w/o anyone around.

(Thursday – July 4)
Back at it today! I jumped into a completely new area: Git and Git Bash. It felt like shifting gears entirely from what I’ve been doing lately. But surprisingly it’s not as intimidating as I thought. I practiced various Git commands, learned how to use branches, how to clone repositories, and started getting comfortable with navigating and managing versions and so on. Pretty satisfying to see how it helps keep everything organized and I can already tell how useful it’ll be for all my projects going forward.
