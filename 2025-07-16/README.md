# Coding Study Log (When review, just view files w/o numbers or protos on them)

Today, I spent time fixing and improving various errors in the project, as well as adding a few new enhancements.

Since most of us on the team aren’t that used to merging each other’s code through GitHub yet (GitHub itself in the first place), I took the lead and did a bit of extra studying on how to handle it properly. Turns out, it’s pretty straightforward once you understand Pull Requests.
So we decided on a simple workflow:
everyone creates their own branch off the main branch, pushes their individual work there, and then opens a pull request. This way others can review and approve before merging into main. It’s such a handy feature; makeing collaboration way easier and a lot cleaner.

As for my part I’ve already completed the board system; our Phase 3 goal, and pushed both the frontend and backend code to my GitHub branch. I even merged the frontend changes into the main branch. And so, finally, now the project is really starting to take shape.

Seeing it all gradually come together is pretty exciting. Let’s keep the work going!
