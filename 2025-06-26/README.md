# Coding Study Log (When review, just view files w/o numbers or protos on them)

Alright, so today I kept working on my card game project using Axios. One of the main things I focused on was putting a limit to the number of cards, which feels like a small but important gameplay feature. I also spent time cleaning up the UI, trying to make everything feel a bit more polished and user-friendly. It’s starting to look more like a real app now.

On the backend side, I took my first steps into learning about @Transactional. I tried applying it to the part of the code where users gain or lose gold and dice, aiming to make those updates atomic. Unfortunately… it didn’t quite work the way I expected. Something’s clearly off, and I’ll need to dig deeper to understand why the transaction isn’t rolling back properly. Maybe it’s something with the database config or the method boundaries?

Every time I run into a problem, it’s frustrating, but I'll get there.
