# Coding Study Log (When review, just view files w/o numbers or protos on them)

Alright, Today, I took a deeper dive into Git.
Following up on yesterday’s experiments with cloning, I ran various tests on pulling from remote repositories. I also explored some public GitHub repositories by cloning and pulling them, just to browse through different people’s source code. It was actually pretty interesting to see how others structure their projects and write their code. (Understood like only 10% of what these codes were trying to do though)

And... I studied stash. To be honest, I still don’t fully grasp why it’s so important.
(But thinking about it… I guess stash is crucial when you need to quickly switch contexts; like putting aside your current changes without committing, so you can jump to another branch to handle something urgent. Especially helpful in team environments or when doing hotfixes. Like when a supervisor asks you to do something else when you are on sth... I guess)

After that, I tried out tags and also worked on merging.
Merging turned out to be trickier than I expected; I ran into quite a few conflicts and spent a good chunk of time resolving them. I did manage to sort things out in the end, but it’s clear there’s still a lot for me to struggle.

Because I kept hearing that GUI tools can make Git easier, I decided to download SourceTree (hope it was a good choice).
I spent most of the afternoon just getting familiar with it. Compared to working purely in the terminal, seeing the branches and history visually makes it so much clearer. I’ll try to balance using both CLI and GUI moving forward.

For tomorrow, I might try doing some rebasing in SourceTree, or even poke around with Git hooks just to see what’s possible.
