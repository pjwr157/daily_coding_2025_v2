# Coding Study Log

Alright, so today was def a productive day!

I dove deeper into Axios, and for the first time, I actually used axios.post in my project. It felt like a significant step forward since most of my previous work was with get. Understanding how to send data to the backend and seeing it function properly really helped me solidify how client-server communication works in practice. Tbh, more deeper understanding to how the pokemon pocket game that I'm recently into works.

There are quite a few files involved today, so when reviewing, I want you to remember to view the files without numbers or proto in their names.

Also, I realized I forgot to write yesterday’s log,, And so, I studied how to build a dice function and also explored more about the controller API, which laid the groundwork for everything I tackled today.

Looking ahead, I think I’ll try experimenting with how to handle error messages and responses from post requests, maybe even display them properly in the UI. I’d also like to explore how to chain API calls or manage multiple requests more clearly/properly.
