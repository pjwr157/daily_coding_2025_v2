# Coding Study Log (When review, just view files w/o numbers or protos on them)

Today,  I focused on aligning and arranging the overall structure of our project code.
It took quite a bit of time since we had to go through everything and make adjustments, but in the end, things are much more organized now. The plan is to finish refining and polishing everything by Friday; and I think time will be sufficient.

Aside from coding, there’s a lot on my mind lately. (I know I write stuff like this on the comment. But,, this seems important to record, so here I write.)
I need to decide by the end of this week whether I’ll accept the job offer from MinebeaMitsumi. Honestly, I’m not sure. From the very beginning, my experience with them hasn’t felt all that smooth or positive. It makes me wonder if that’s a sign of what working there might be like.

It’s hard; weighing a career path that might not feel right versus the uncertainty of other options. But, decision are to be made soon. I’ll take some time to think carefully and trust what feels right for me.
