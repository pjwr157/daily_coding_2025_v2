# Coding Study Log (When review, just view files w/o numbers or protos on them)

Alright, Today was officially the first real prep day for our team project; and it kicked off with a big fail.

Right from the start, I ran into a huge roadblock: I couldn’t get the database (MySQL) to connect at all. No matter what I tried, every log kept showing 0 (meaning the connection wasn’t working). I spent nearly five hours debugging, testing different configs, and scouring through settings, but absolutely nothing worked.

By the end of the day, I was completely exhausted and honestly pretty frustrated.
But overcoming these kinds of headaches is exactly what will stop me from making these mysterious mistakes again in the future. It’s part of the process, even if it feels rough right now.

Tomorrow, I’ll come back with a clear head and try again.

<!-- Going to have a mock interview tmr... kinda nervous and tbh not prepared as I was bust with the project TT ; 2025.07.09 -->
