# Coding Study Log

Alright, so today, I had a conversation with the president of the company where I’m currently training. While I haven’t officially started working yet, I’m involved as a trainee. Because of that meeting and the general lack of time, I couldn’t study as much coding today as I’d hoped.

That said, I still managed to focus on one of the more challenging concepts I’ve encountered recently; useEffect in React. I tried to understand not just how to use it, but what exactly happens behind the scenes when it's triggered. It’s slowly starting to make more sense. It’s interesting how it lets you deal with side effects in a way that feels both impactful and a bit confusing at first.

After that, I spent time learning about Event Object. Honestly, it’s really not my favorite topic. It felt more complex than I expected, and the more I read, the more I realized how deep it goes. Still, I know it’s an important part of how user interactions work, so I’m trying not to back away from it. I think with more examples, it’ll start to roll, not now though.

I also briefly looked at some code related to form processing. I didn’t get to practice much; just read and observed. I’m planning to continue that on Monday, and also start digging more into Axios.

Even though today was shorter study-wise, I still feel glad I kept going. Some days won’t be as productive as others, but I will get there, some day. I’ll make progress, some day.
