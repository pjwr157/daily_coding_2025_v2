# Coding Study Log (When review, just view files w/o numbers or protos on them)

Today, I focused on unifying the overall structure of our project code; making sure everything is consistent across the board. I also completed the remaining tasks for Phase 2 of the board feature.

As I was working through it, I felt that the project needed a clearer structure and flow, so I went ahead and built a homepage. It’s still kind of a blueprint version, but I’m honestly proud of how it turned out. It really helps bring the whole project together.
