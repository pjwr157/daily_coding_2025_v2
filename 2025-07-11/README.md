====================================================================================================================

And... so, Today marks the completion of Phase 1!!!
MySQL and Spring are connected and working flawlessly. React JS is also properly linked with the backend, and it displays data on the UI just as expected.

I also cleaned up the overall framework a bit and even did some CSS styling, which I hadn’t touched in a while; it was nice to see the interface start to look more polished and look like an actual site.

Starting next week, we’ll jump into Phase 3 to work on the board system. Phase 2 will have to wait. It’s been a while since I last implemented a full board feature, so I know it’ll be challenging; but just like always, I’ll figure it out step by step.
