# Coding Study Log (When review, just view files w/o numbers or protos on them)

Today, was a slightly light coding day; I mostly checked for any remaining bugs, made a few small tweaks, and added some comments throughout the code to make things clearer. It was more about wrapping things up than building something new.

But honestly,,, I couldn’t really focus.
The thing is, I got the call today; a call saying that I passed my interview from Monday!
Extremely happy and relieved thb. It’s one of those moments where everything feels worth it. I’ve been studying the company and prepared for the interviews immensly, and it’s amazing to see it lead to something real.

However,, If, I decide to take the job, it’ll be a global sales position. So... I probably won’t be able to do much coding for a while (Prob for both as a job and for study wise). Still, I really want to keep studying and learn whenever I can. Even if it’s just a little bit at a time; I don’t want to lose the progress I’ve made.
