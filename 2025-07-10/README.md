# Coding Study Log (When review, just view files w/o numbers or protos on them)

Alright, Today, I finally wrapped up the basic groundwork for both the frontend and backend of our project, along with the MySQL setup. The site is slowly starting to take shape, which feels pretty satisfying to see.

And the best part — after all those struggles, I finally got the MySQL connection to work!
Maybe that’s why once it was working, I felt all the energy drain out of me. It was like my body just completely relaxed after days of tension.

Now it’s time to head home and switch gears to prepare for my interviews.
Let’s keep giving it everything — one day at a time.
